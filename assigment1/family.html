              <p>Family is very important and valuable to me and it is something that should never be taken for granted.  No matter what my family makes up a huge part of who am I today. Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing. My family is a small family with four peoples. My mother is a great woman. She is currently unemployed and now staying at home doing housework. She always took care of me and my little sister very well. My father is an air force and a musician. He is a really hardworking man and I would like to thank him for showing me what a hardworking man truly is and for teaching me how to be more responsible. In this world of doubt, insecurity and fear, my family is always there for me.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">With family playing such a major role in our identities, it’s no wonder that great writers, celebrated thinkers, and observant luminaries have had such amazing insights into what it means to be a family. Read words from Walt Disney, Mother Teresa, Winston Churchill, Barbara Bush, and George Bernard Shaw, among others, and see what they’ve had to say about familial bonds. And then remember to go FaceTime with your mother</p>
